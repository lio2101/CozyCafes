  story:
  - '... /p Barista ... [player], if I may? If you could spare a minute of your time?

    /p
    Thank you/p

    I wanted to express my gratitude for this shop. Places like
    these have gotten rare with time. /p I can''t quite explain it. /p ... /p That
    is all.'
  - .../p [player], I must confess, I find myself coming back to this place more
    often than I plan to. /p I feel, it might be connected to the nostalgia of my
    old home. Perhaps I should take this as a sign. /p I will have to reflect on
    this on my own please excuse me.
  - .../p Regarding our last conversation, I have decided I will be moving back to
    my old home. /p Your company and this environment has made me realize I do not
    belong in this crowded city. /p I appreciate you hearing me out. If you'd excuse
    me now, I have some packing to do.
  - In more personal matters, I thought I would let you know that I have settled
    into my new... old... life very well. /p I doubt that this revelation would have
    been possible without you, [player], I am grateful. /p I will make sure to still
    pay you a visit from time to time. /pI guess I have grown quite fond of these
    drinks. And the person serving them.
