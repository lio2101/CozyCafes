  story:
  - 'I should probably introduce myself! My name is Willow! /p ... /p Oh no I''m
    doing it again aren''t I? I''m sorry haha. /p I have some memory problems. Sometimes
    I notice it but a lot of the times I don''t... /p I hope you don''t mind. /p
    A lot of my classmates hate it. /p They say it''s annoying. /p But as long as
    I''m kind and stay positive things will be okay! /p ... /p Sorry I zoned out.
    /p What was I saying? /p Not important! '
  - "College was fun this week! /p \u2026 /p Sometimes I forget what my assignments
    are\u2026 or even the names of my teachers. /p That\u2019s a little embarrassing,
    haha. /p But everyone\u2019s busy with their own stuff anyway, right? /p I just
    try to do my best and\u2026 /p Oh, I think I forgot what I was saying. /p Not
    important! /p College was fun this week! /p I meet people, we laugh\u2026 /p
    And sometimes I learn things. /p That\u2019s what counts, isn\u2019t it?"
  - "I woke up today and had a super weird feeling\u2026 /p Like I\u2019m supposed
    to be somewhere. /p I can\u2019t remember where\u2026 /p But it must not be that
    important, right? /p I ended up just staying in my room for a while. /p Then
    I wandered around a little bit and ended up here! /p I feel a little silly sometimes,
    but\u2026 /p Life is full of little adventures, aren\u2019t they? /p And I always
    try to smile. /p That helps."
  - "My name is Willow by the way! What's yours? /p ...  /p Something super funny
    happened to me yesterday. /p My house just disappeared! It wasn't where it was
    before. And I walked and walked\u2026 /p And then, well\u2026 /p I ended up sleeping
    on a park bench. /p It wasn\u2019t scary, really\u2026 /p I think. /p A neighbor
    found me, though! /p He brought me home, which was really nice of him. /p Now
    he takes care of me. /p He's a social worker or something? That sounds like a
    fun job. I'm not sure what it means tho. /p He's waiting outside so we can walk
    back home, so I better get going!"
