  story:
  - ... /p Please excuse my absence recently. You see, my body did not allow me to
    leave my quarters. /p Chronic weakness has unfortunately always run in my blood
    line. /p I am thankful to have your shop in close distance. /p Even on days where
    strength does not come to me easily, at least I get to experience your magic
    drinks. /p I am a bit out of breath, I think I will sit down for a while before
    I take my leave.
  - '... /p Sorry I am feeling a bit weak today. The symptoms are more frequent during
    this season. /p But I cannot complain. In her last years, my mother was not even
    able to speak. /p She has been in cryo sleep for 20 years now. Bless her heart.
    /p I should get back home. Let me just rest my wings for a bit. /p Thank you
    for listening, dear.  '
  - ... /p I tried to walk a bit farther today. The air felt heavy at first, but
    it grew lighter with every step. /p Maybe my strength is not returning. Maybe
    I am simply learning to move within its limits. /p There is comfort in that,
    I think. /p I used to resent this frail body, but lately I find myself listening
    to it instead. /p We all have our own journey to go, and I am grateful for mine
    nontheless.
  - ... /p I stopped by not for the drink this time, but for the warmth. /p I have
    learned that healing is not always a battle to win, sometimes it is a truce to
    keep. /p The days still tire me, but I no longer measure them by what I cannot
    do. /p Today I reached the shop. Tomorrow, perhaps, I will sit outside a little
    longer. /p That will be enough. Thank you [player].
