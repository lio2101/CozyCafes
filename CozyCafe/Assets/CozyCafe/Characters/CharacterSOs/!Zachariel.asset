  story:
  - '... /p It looks like my appointment got canceled. /p ... /p I am not used to
    having free time. If I am not at work, I am taking care of my siblings. /p They
    are still young, they shouldn''t have to worry about things like money. /p ...
    /p Oh, I''m getting a call from work. '
  - "... /p I got up a bit earlier today so I could stop by again. I guess it\u2019s
    almost part of my routine now, haha. /p It\u2019s strange. being here makes time
    feel slower. /p Maybe that\u2019s why I like it. /p When I sit here, it\u2019s
    like the world doesn\u2019t need me for a moment. /p ... /p It\u2019s nice. Uncomfortable,
    but nice. /p Oh no, I almost forgot the time again. You should really install
    a clock in this place... or maybe not."
  - "... /p My coworker told me I don\u2019t always have to be the strong one. /p
    I brushed it off at first, old habits, I guess. /p But yesterday, when the deadlines
    piled up, I actually asked her to take one of my shifts. /p She said yes. Just
    like that. /p The world didn\u2019t collapse, and no one thought less of me.
    /p It felt strange, almost too easy, but also like breathing out after holding
    it in for too long haha. /p Maybe strength isn\u2019t about carrying everything
    alone after all. /p Perhaps I will offer this drink to her instead, as a thank
    you."
  - "... /p I asked my neighbor to watch the kids tonight. /p They were thrilled,
    apparently she makes better hot chocolate than I do haha. /p For the first time
    in weeks, I came here without rushing, without excuses. /p I used to think I
    needed to keep everyone safe by never resting, never stopping. /p But maybe taking
    care of myself is part of that, too. /p The world still spins, the house still
    stands, and I\u2019m still here... /p ... /p I cannot thank you enough, [player]."
