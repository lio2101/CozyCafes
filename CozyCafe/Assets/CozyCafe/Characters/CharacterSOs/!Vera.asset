  story:
  - I've been meaning to ask you, Do you know anything about that empty shop down
    the street?/p I've always wanted to open an atelier for my art. It's like a dream
    of mine.../p My parents don't like to hear about it though. They don't think
    art is a job. /p Sigh. /p Oh gosh I'm sorry I didn't mean to rant. /p I will
    leave you to your shift. Thank you for listening!
  - I know, I know you're busy. But I have some exciting news! /p It turns out that
    building is actually for sale! I called the seller and the price is very reasonable
    too. /p It would be so nice... We would be neighbors! Haha /p Now I just need
    to somehow tell my parents... /p ... /p I will keep you updated on it.
  - 'So... /p I have good and bad news. /p The good news is... /p I was able to take
    out a loan and the empty shop is officially mine!!! Can you believe it? /p Unfortunately
    my parents did not take it very well. /p But you know, sometimes you have to
    stand up for your dreams. /p I''m sure they will understand with time. /p Thank
    you for listening, friend. '
  - So, how is your shop coming along, neighbor? You've gotten quite a few regulars
    by now I see. /p That makes me really happy to see. This place more than deserves
    it! /p My atelier turned out amazing. I finally feel like I can be who I always
    wanted to be. /p Thank you, for always having an open ear for me. I'm glad to
    have such a good friend just around the corner.
