    text: This draught is most delectable. Verily, this must be the beverage of which
      mine attendant spake. /p I thank thee most graciously.

    text: Methinks this beverage would fare better with more milk. Mayhap thou shalt
      perfect it anon.
  - type: 5
    text: "Hmmm\u2026 this measure of milk doth somewhat weaken the flavor. What
      a pity."
  - type: 6
    text: I know not if this taste belongeth rightly to a mocha. Perchance thou shouldst
      attempt another next time?

    text: A trifle bland. Something, methinks, is wanting.
  goodbye: If thou wilt pardon me, I must away to attend other affairs.
  story:
  - This place doth serve as a most pleasant respite from the burdens of mine accustomed
    royal duties. /p Of late, I am oft summoned to councils concerning my future.
    /p Yet, truth be told, I hold no fondness for any of the suitors my father doth
    present as candidates for marriage. /p Though I feel bound by duty to make a
    choice, my heart inclineth me otherwise. /p I beseech thee, keep this knowledge
    in thy confidence.
  - "Of recent days I have found myself in greater discourse with the townsfolk that
    dwell along these streets. /p They bear a warmth far truer than the hollow courtesies
    spoken within the walls of my family\u2019s estate. /p A young maiden did offer
    me a pastry, slightly underbaked, yet most endearing, /p and it did fill my heart
    with a curious joy. I find myself hoping that our paths may cross once more."
  - Pray pardon my weary countenance this day. /p Sleep hath eluded me of late, and
    my thoughts are beset by visions of scorched bread and the gentle, blue eyes
    of the young maiden. /p I sought counsel from mine physician, who did surmise
    that I suffer from what mortals call a crush. /p I remain uncertain how I ought
    to regard such an affliction.
  - "I\u2026 I daresay my spirits are lighter this day. /p It astonisheth me that
    thou hast perceived it, for I had thought my heart well hidden. /p Indeed, I
    have spoken oft with Mistress Saph, the lady of the bread, and she bringeth unto
    my days a peace I scarce believed I could feel. /p Yet I am ever longing for
    her presence when she is gone. /p I have made known to my father that I have
    found one who stirreth my heart, and thus he hath ceased his insistence upon
    further councils. /p Who can tell? Mayhap in days to come, my realm shall be
    graced by the reign of two queens."
