  story:
  - '.../p To be honest... I only come here because my therapist says I need to have
    more social interactions. /p The first time I came here, I stood outside for
    an hour because I was too scared to go Inside. /p Silly, I know./p I don''t even
    need to hydrate since you know... water folks. /p Anyway... '
  - ... /p I just wanted to say, I really like your shop and I... don't mind talking
    to you. /p You're a kind person [player].
  - ... /p I'm not very good at talking, or standing up for myself. But I think coming
    here has really helped. /p You know... /p Yesterday someone talked to me in front
    of your shop. I was scared at frist, /p but it turns out we both enjoy making
    art. Maybe it's not so bad to share things sometimes.
  - ... /p I'm meeting up with my new friend today. We talked a bit more. /p I'm
    a bit nervous but, I think I'm ready to open up more. /p Thank you so much for
    being patient with me [player].
